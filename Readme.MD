MakeMeMod - Change permission groups with a command back and forth

MakeMeMod allows you to specify simple commands which move you from your existing permission group into another.

This allows Moderators and Admins to be a normal player during daytime and become the defender of the unfortunate during night... Ã¤hmm.. well... I mean... you know..

By defining a command and a permission group with it you can just issue that command and your permission group will be changed to it. If you issue it again you are back in your old group.

To allow the usage of that command you just need to give the player the corresponding right directly:

makememod.change.XXXXXXX where XXXXXX is the command the player should be allowed to use.

This plugin is coming from Bukkit but will use the integrated permission api only, so it should work with all upcoming permission plugins for Spout
